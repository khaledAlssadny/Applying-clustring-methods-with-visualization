Data Set Link : https://www.kaggle.com/aryashah2k/credit-card-customer-data
Description : A Customer Credit Card Information Dataset which can be used for Identifying Loyal Customers, Customer Segmentation, Targeted Marketing and other such use cases in the Marketing Industry.
Content :
The Attributes Include:
-	Sl_No
-	Customer Key
-	AvgCreditLimit
-	TotalCreditCards
-	Totalvisitsbank
-	Totalvisitsonline
-	Totalcallsmade

The target from this application :
-	Perform Gathering data , Assessing , Data-Cleaning , Preprocessing  and Feature Engineering on the Dataset.
-	Visualization the data and extract our observations about it
-	Applying Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering algorithm, and K-Medoids algorithm and visualize the two clusters 
-	Compare between the two clustering algorithm and find out which the better one with silhouette score function 
-	Customer segmentation and  plotting that with all features for two clustering algorithms 
-	Extract our observations from the two clustering algorithm after doing customer segmentation and checking the loyalty of customers 

The Work on the data :
- applying the hierarchal clustering and K medoid clustering to the data 
- we assessing the data using visualization techniques and extract observations from it , make data segmentation and Compare between the two clustering algorithms with segmentation and visualization and find out which the better one with silhouette score function
